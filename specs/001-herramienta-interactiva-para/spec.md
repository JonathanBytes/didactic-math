## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A child (ages 6-10) wants to learn how numbers are composed of units, tens, hundreds, and thousands, and how to add two multi-digit numbers. At the start, a teacher (or the system randomly) provides two numbers. The application presents the first number (e.g., 5214) and the child decomposes it by selecting the appropriate category buttons (unit, ten, hundred, thousand) and depositing them into a visual cylinder. The child can undo the last piece if needed. After correctly completing the first number's decomposition, the second number appears and the child fills a second cylinder. Finally, both cylinders are displayed together to visualize the sum. Progress is saved in the browser so the child can resume if interrupted.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the application starts, **When** the teacher or system setup begins, **Then** the system prompts to either enter two numbers manually or generate them randomly

2. **Given** numbers are configured, **When** the child views the main screen, **Then** the first number up to 4 digits is displayed center-left, category selection buttons (1/Unit, 10/Ten, 100/Hundred, 1000/Thousand) appear top-right, two empty cylinders appear on the right (only the first is active), and a "CONTAR / TERMINAR" button appears bottom-left with an undo button nearby

3. **Given** a number is displayed (e.g., 2345), **When** the child selects the "100/Hundred" button twice, **Then** the system deposits 2 hundred-pieces into the current cylinder and visually updates the cylinder

4. **Given** the child made a mistake, **When** the child presses the undo button, **Then** the system removes the last added piece from the cylinder and updates the visual display

5. **Given** the child tries to add too many pieces of a category, **When** the child presses a category button that would exceed the number's decomposition, **Then** the system blocks the action and does not add the piece

6. **Given** the child has correctly decomposed the first number into the first cylinder, **When** the child presses "CONTAR / TERMINAR", **Then** the system validates, displays the second number, and enables the second cylinder

7. **Given** the child has incorrectly decomposed a number, **When** the child presses "CONTAR / TERMINAR", **Then** the system provides gentle feedback indicating the error and allows correction

8. **Given** both numbers have been successfully decomposed into their respective cylinders, **When** the child completes the second number, **Then** the system displays both filled cylinders side by side and shows the visual sum

9. **Given** cylinders are being filled, **When** the child adds pieces, **Then** each piece type is visually distinct (different colors or sizes) to represent units, tens, hundreds, and thousands

10. **Given** the exercise is in progress, **When** the child closes or refreshes the browser, **Then** the system saves progress to localStorage and restores it on return

11. **Given** the exercise is completed, **When** the sum is displayed, **Then** the system clears the saved progress from localStorage

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the child selects too many pieces for a category (e.g., tries to add 5 hundreds when the number only has 2)?
  - System blocks the action entirely - the piece is not added and the cylinder remains unchanged
  
- How does the system handle when the child presses "COUNT/FINISH" without completing the decomposition?
  - System provides encouraging feedback like "Keep going! You're not quite done yet" and highlights missing pieces

- What happens when the child wants to undo or remove a piece from the cylinder?
  - Child presses the undo button which removes the most recently added piece
  - Multiple undos remove pieces in reverse order (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
  - If cylinder is empty, undo button is disabled or provides no action

- What happens if the child leaves the application mid-exercise?
  - Progress is automatically saved to browser localStorage
  - On return, the exact state is restored (current number, cylinder contents, which cylinder is active)
  - When exercise completes successfully, localStorage is cleared

- What happens if the teacher/system provides invalid numbers at setup?
  - Numbers must be validated to be between 1 and 9999
  - Non-numeric input is rejected with clear error message

- What happens if localStorage is full or unavailable?
  - System degrades gracefully - exercise continues but cannot be resumed after closing browser

- **FR-007**: System MUST allow children to select a category button and deposit the corresponding piece into the active cylinder

- **FR-009**: System MUST visually represent each deposited piece in the cylinder with distinct visual characteristics per category (different colors or sizes)
- **FR-010**: System MUST track the decomposition state of each number in real-time

#### Undo Functionality

#### Visual Cylinders
- **FR-015**: System MUST display exactly two cylinders on the right side of the screen as visual containers for decomposed number pieces
- **FR-016**: Each cylinder MUST use a distinct color to differentiate between the first and second numbers
- **FR-017**: Only the cylinder for the current number MUST be active/enabled; the other MUST be visually disabled
- **FR-018**: Cylinders MUST visually accumulate pieces as the child adds them, showing progress

#### Validation & Progression
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide a "CONTAR / TERMINAR" (Count/Finish) button in the bottom-left area
- **FR-020**: When "CONTAR / TERMINAR" is pressed, system MUST validate whether the decomposition matches the displayed number
- **FR-021**: If first number's decomposition is correct, system MUST display the second number and enable the second cylinder
- **FR-022**: If second number's decomposition is correct, system MUST proceed to the final sum visualization
- **FR-023**: If decomposition is incorrect, system MUST provide age-appropriate, encouraging feedback without harsh error messages
- **FR-024**: System MUST prevent advancing until the current decomposition is correct

#### Final Sum Visualization
- **FR-025**: When both numbers have been successfully decomposed, system MUST display both filled cylinders side by side
- **FR-026**: System MUST provide a visual representation that helps children understand the sum of the two numbers
- **FR-027**: System MUST show the relationship between individual decompositions and the total sum
